<details>
    <summary>What are the different API functions supported by Node.js?</summary>

  There are two types of API functions:-  
 - **Synchronous APIs** : Used for non-blocking functions
 - **Asynchronous APIs** : Used for blocking functions
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronus functions?</summary>
    
    **Synchronous APIs**
 - Synchronous APIs are mainly used for I/O operations.
 - They are intantaneous in providing a respone to the data movement in the server and keep up with the data as per the requirement.
 - If there are no responses, then the API will throw an error.
    
    **Asynchronous APIs**
 - Asynchronous functions, as the name suggests, work on the basis of not being synchronous.
 - Here, HTTP requests, when pushed will not wait for a response to begin. Responses to any previous requests will be continuous even if the server has already got the response.
